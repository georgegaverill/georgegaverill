- 👋 Hi, I’m George (@georgegaverill)
- 👀 I’m  particularly interest in preventative medicine, health data analytics and visualisation. 
- 👀 Any software or other tools tha seeks to make lives more enjoyable for those receiving or delivering health care also has my attention.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some more Python after a break and starting with one of the O'Reilly books on Machine Learning. Sadly my only active projects otherwise at the moment are around improving some visual basic code that is used extensively in my hospital.
- 💞️ I would be happy to look at collaborating on any interesting projects you are untaking in health or social care domain. I will bring contextual awareness, contacts, some analytical skills and determination. 
- 🏃 Outside of improving coding and working in the hospital, I like to spend  time running, practicing yoga and sea swimming.
